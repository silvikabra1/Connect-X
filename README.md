### Connect-X

# Description

Connect-X is a 2-player variation of popular board game Connect 4. Instead of having to connect four pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, the user gets to pick the number of pieces to connect, anywhere from 3-9! Once the game starts, the players will alternate turns, and time will be kept until one of the players wins. From there, the player's time may get added to the leaderboard if it's in the top 5 times!
